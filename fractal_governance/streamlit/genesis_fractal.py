st.markdown(
    """
The goal of Fractal Governance is lofty: incentivize people to collaborate in the
production of public goods and services that eliminates corruption and graft in the
process.

The principles of Fractal Governance are described in the book
[More Equal Animals](https://moreequalanimals.com) by Daniel Larimer, and the technical
specifications for how to implement Fractal Governance at scale is defined in the
[fractally White Paper](https://fractally.com).

This is a live dashboard that follows the first group of people to govern themselves
according to these principles and technical specifications.

The word *fractal* is used throughput this dashboard and is capitalized as *Fractal*
depending on the context to distinguish between the usual mathematical meaning and its
specific use in governance.

The first governing body based on the specifications and principles of Fractal
Governance is called [Genesis](https://gofractally.com/groups/7064857/feed). The
Genesis members meet weekly to mine the inherent value of their collaboration to
produce public goods and services and return that mined value, tokenized in units
called *Respect*, directly back to its members through a governance process that
naturally prevents corruption and graft. This incorruptibility is the defining feature
of Fractal Governance.

Fractal Governance directly and consistently rewards individuals for their recent past
contributions towards the creation of public goods and services that also avoids the
formation of Pareto distributions due to corruption and graft found in all other known
forms of governance. Gone are the days of rewarding collusion with illicit gains (such
as currency) from dishonest behavior or other questionable means.

Analogous to Bitcoin's *Proof of Work* consensus algorithm which rewards people for
transforming stored energy, in the form of electricity, into an incorruptible public
ledger of account, a collaboration of people governed in a Fractal nature also uses a
*Proof of Work* consensus algorithm to reward people for transforming stored energy, in
the form of human collaboration, into public goods and services.

The fundamental difference between the two consensus algorithms is in how rewards are
allocated. The Bitcoin model allocates rewards called BTC tokens to those who consume
the most electricity most consistently. The Fractal model, on the other hand, allocates
rewards called Respect tokens to those who contribute the most value most consistently,
as judged by their peers.

The Bitcoin consensus algorithm is prone to corruption and graft because it rewards
those that obtain the most consistent source of electricity by any means whatsoever,
illicit or otherwise. The Fractal Governance consensus algorithm, on the other hand,
prevents corruption and graft by eliminating opportunities for collusion.

The nature of how the rewards from the Bitcoin and Fractal Governance systems are
recorded is similar in  that both systems use a blockchain for their public ledger of
account.

This dashboard will automatically update when new changes are pushed to its
[Github repository](https://github.com/matt-langston/fractal_governance).
